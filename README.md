## The project
This project intends to document the current needs of the Joomla Translations Working Group needs that we want to solve in 2014. We request community participation by commenting, advising, consulting and helping to develop the final solution that could bring the Joomla Internationalization to the next level. 

### The Team
The Joomla Content Management System translation is carried by people all arround the world that volunteer their time organised in teams, the **Translation Working group** (also called the Joomla! Translation Coordination Team) and the **Translation Teams**.

The purpose of the **Translation Working Group** is to be a liaison between the Joomla! Translation Teams, the International Community and the other Joomla! Teams on user and technical matters relating to the translation of the Joomla! application.

In brief the main task of the Translation Teams consist in translate and adapt to the Joomla default language en-GB (english - Great Britain) to other languages:

* in the installer: [https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/staging/installation/language](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/staging/installation/language)
