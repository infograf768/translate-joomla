translate.joomla.org project
===========

translate.joomla.org is the starting point of a new working team that wants to give answer to a specific goal stablished by the Joomla Production Leadership Team in 2013 (see http://developer.joomla.org/news/74-production-goals-for-2013.html):

> **Goal #5**: Improve processes in Translating the Joomla Software and support the enhancement of the Joomla CMS multilingual system.

Specifically to one of its targets:

> **5.2: Halve the dedicated time needed by a Translation Team member to provide a language package for Joomla.**
> In agreement with the Translation Team, dedicate resources on improving processes and tools to automate the creation of translation packages and uploading them to the Joomla Languages Server.

Soon we will provide more information with a detailed ToDo list and a place for community participation.
